- Tooltip Text Searched For: "Use: Adds this toy to your Toy Box."

**Filter Appearance Items:**

- Tooltip text is searched for "Use: Add this appearance to your collection."

**Filter Creatable Items:**

- Tooltip text is searched for "Use: Create a soulbound item appropriate for your loot specialization."

**Openable Items:**

- Tooltip text is searched for "Open the container", "Use: Open", "Right Click to Open."

**Lockboxes:**

**Filter Generic on Use Items:** (Default is disabled)
