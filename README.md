## Overview

BetterBags Openable Items helps in organizing your bag by filtering and categorizing items like Toys, Appearance Items, Creatable Items, and more.

## Features and Usage

You can access the configuration through the BetterBags addon configuration panel. Here are the available options and their categories:

**Filter Toys:**

- Tooltip Text Searched For: "Use: Adds this toy to your Toy Box."

**Filter Appearance Items:**

- Tooltip text is searched for "Use: Add this appearance to your collection."

**Filter Creatable Items:**

- Tooltip text is searched for "Use: Create a soulbound item appropriate for your loot specialization."

**Openable Items:**

- Tooltip text is searched for "Open the container", "Use: Open", "Right Click to Open."

**Lockboxes:**

- Tooltip text is searched for "Locked."

**Filter Generic on Use Items:** (Default is disabled)

- Tooltip text is searched for "Use:"
- All other filters will be checked first. If this option is enabled, it will be used as a final catch for anything that does not fit elsewhere.
